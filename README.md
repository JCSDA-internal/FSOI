# Forecast Sensitivity to Observations and Observation Impact

The tools in this project are used to perform an intercomparison study on the use of observations in data assimilation and their impacts on reducing forecast errors at major numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers around the world.

The study is spearheaded by the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) and the participating NWP centers are:

1. U.K. Met Office
2. U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Marine Meteorology Division
3. Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
4. Météo-France
5. Japan Meteorological Agency
6. NCEP Environmental Modeling Center
